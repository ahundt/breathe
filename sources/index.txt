.. BreatheExample documentation master file, created by sphinx-quickstart on Tue Feb  3 18:20:48 2009.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Breathe's documentation
=======================

Breathe provides a bridge between the Sphinx and Doxygen documentation systems.

The aim is provide an easy way to include Doxygen output in a set of documention
generated by Sphinx. The system relies on the Doxygen's xml output.

Directives
----------

These directives are a work in progress and may change in syntax as the project
develops.

In each case the ``project`` and ``path`` options have the following meaning.

Where:

``project``
   Specifies which project, as defined in the breathe_projects config value,
   should be used for this directive. This overrides the default project if one
   has been specified.

``path``
   Directly specifies the patht to the folder with the doxygen output. This
   overrides the project and default project if they have bee specified.


doxygenindex Directive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directive processes and produces output for everything described by the
Doxygen xml output. It reads the ``index.xml`` file and process everything
referenced by it.

::

   .. doxygenindex::
      :project: ...
      :path: ...

doxygenfunction Directive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This directive generates the appropriate output for a single function. Currently
the function name is required to be unique in the project. There are plans for
options for adding further criteria to narrow the search if there are multiple
matches.

::

   .. doxygenfunction:: <function name>
      :project: ...
      :path: ...


Config Values
-------------

**breathe_projects**
   This should be a dictionary in which the keys are project names and the values are
   paths to the folder containing the doxygen output for that project.

**breathe_default_project**
   This should match one of the keys in the **breathe_projects** dictionary and
   indicates which project should be used when the project is not specified on
   the directive.
