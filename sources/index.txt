Breathe's documentation
=======================

Breathe provides a bridge between the Sphinx and Doxygen documentation systems.

The aim is provide an easy way to include Doxygen output in a set of documentation
generated by Sphinx. The system relies on the Doxygen's xml output.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   quickstart
   directives
   contributing
   codeguide
   testpages

In a Nutshell
-------------

You write code that looks a little like this:

.. literalinclude:: nutshell.h
   :language: cpp

Then you run this::

   doxygen

With a setting that says this::

   GENERATE_XML = YES

Then in your Sphinx documentation, you add something like this::

   .. doxygenclass:: Nutshell

And you get something like this:

----

   .. doxygenclass:: Nutshell
      :project: nutshell

----

Sound reasonable? To get started, go checkout the :doc:`quickstart guide <quickstart>`.
